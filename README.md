# YouTube Watch History Analysis:

## Project Description

This project explores patterns in my personal YouTube watch history to identify trends in content preferences and how they change, if they change over time. By categorizing the videos I watched into types such as music, education, sports, gaming etc. and analyzing their frequency, I aim to learn insights about my viewing habits and engagement patterns. This analysis will involve time-based trends such as daily, weekly, seasonal and correlations with factors like time of the day.

The goal is to visualize and understand my content consumption.

## Project Idea and Plan

### Objective
To analyze content engagement patterns by:
1. Categorizing videos based on content type (e.g., entertainment, education, music).
2. Grouping the data by month and time of day to identify trends in viewing habits.
3. Visualizing patterns in engagement, such as peak months for specific content types or time preferences.

### Planning
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Export watch history.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert timestamps to months and time intervals.  
   - Define content categories and assign types to videos.

3. **Analysis**:  
   - Analyze video counts across content types for each month.  
   - Explore trends by time of day (e.g., Morning vs. Night). 

4. **Visualization**:
   - Generate charts to represent content consumption patterns.
